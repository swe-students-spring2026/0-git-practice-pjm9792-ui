a paragraph or two about what you find interesting about that article

I read the article [Agile and the Long Crisis of Software](https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/#/) by Miriam Posner. This article talked about the history of the agile software 
engineering methodology. I found it interesting because it details the difficulties of collaboration when working on software. The problem with software engineering is the coordination costs, which cannot be eliminated through beauracracy and tightly controlled streamlined management systems (which was what the Waterfall methodology tried). The agile methdology, which eliminated a lot of the beauracracy and made the task more flexible, made software engineering teams more efficient even though there could be more unpredictable things. It was interesting that flexibility offered by the agile method outweighed the elimination of predictability offered by the waterfall method. However, the article also states the crisis in agile. Although the agile methodology gave developers more flexibility, it does not give them flexibility in what projects they work on (since that is outside of agile's scope) and the beaurcracy elimininatd by the agile methodology may have increased workplace harrassment.

## Comment from Grace Yin
I found your comparison between predictability (waterfall) and flexibility (agile) really clear. The part about agile’s “crisis” stood out to me too—agile can change how teams work day-to-day, but it doesn’t guarantee developers have agency, and removing bureaucracy can sometimes remove protections people rely on.
